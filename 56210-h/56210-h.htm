<h2 id="c1">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>We know it is no longer possible to add anything new to the written word
about Lincoln. The hundreds of historians who have attempted to write
the life of the Great Emancipator have covered every facet of it. Therefore, we
have chosen to present our story of a by-gone day in a series of camera impressions,
hoping to arouse in our readers an emotional sense of &ldquo;present being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have done this for two reasons: first, because Lincoln&rsquo;s early frontier
has achieved a factual and imaginative rebirth through loving care and painstaking
efforts after having fallen into ruin for many years. Secondly, we believe
as many historians do, that America owes much of the credit for its national
character and institutions to the atmosphere of the early frontier. It was the
appreciation of the role it played on the character of Lincoln that brought about
the restoration of New Salem, Illinois, and those objects which were so closely
associated with him. These objects are of special interest because it was among
them that he moved slowly forward through a cycle of failures and successes
before reaching the high place which destiny had reserved for him. No man in
American history has started with so little and achieved so much.</p>
<p>With a certain temerity then, we present our pictorial history of the environment
in which Lincoln spent the most formative years of his life. It was from
this frontier atmosphere and these frontier people that Lincoln acquired his uncanny
understanding of how common folk think and the wisdom that enabled
him to hold in his hands the ties that bound a people and made a nation.</p>

by rolling hills and deep gorges. Here Abe played with his friend,
Austin Gollaher, gathered firewood from the forest, wild berries from the vales,
and for a short time attended Mrs. Hodgen&rsquo;s &ldquo;blab&rdquo; school. Thomas Lincoln
decided to move his family across the Ohio River to live on Pigeon Creek in
Indiana where the soil was richer and there were no slaves.</p>

<h3 id="c3">NEW SALEM</h3>
<p>In the fall of 1828, James Rutledge and John Camron
erected homes on this hill. The following year
they built a grist and sawmill on the Sangamon River
just below the hill, laid out the town of New Salem
and began to sell lots. The mill became so popular that the
town grew rapidly and flourished for several years although
it never included more than one hundred inhabitants. With
the founding and growth of Petersburg, two miles to the north
and more accessibly located, its decline began. When the seat
of the new County of Menard was located at Petersburg in
1839, New Salem quickly passed out of existence.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln resided at New Salem from the
summer of 1831 until the spring of 1837, supporting himself
successively as clerk and mill hand, soldier in the Black Hawk
War, storekeeper, postmaster and deputy surveyor. In 1832 he
entered politics. Although defeated in his first campaign for
the Legislature, he was elected a member of the House of
Representatives in 1834 and again in 1836. Throughout his
residence at New Salem, Lincoln strove to perfect his education,
studying grammar, mathematics, and finally law. Upon his
admission to the bar in March 1837, he sought greater opportunities
than New Salem offered, and so removed to Springfield.</p>

<p class="caphead">It was on a pleasant April day that the flat-bottomed boat, loaded with barrel
pork, corn and live pigs, and piloted by young Abe Lincoln, rounded a bend in
the Sangamon River and came to rest on top of the miller&rsquo;s dam that stretched
out across the river. The bow of the boat was raised high into the air. The
squeals of the frightened pigs brought the citizens of New Salem hurrying down
the bluff to the river bank.</p>
<p class="capbody">This was Lincoln&rsquo;s introduction to the people of New Salem. Denton Offut, a
swaggering, boastful, hard-drinking frontiersman, was owner of the boat. He
became so impressed with the thriving little village that he decided to return
after the voyage to New Orleans, and open a store with Lincoln as his clerk.
The new store was opened the following September.</p>

was the usual type of frontier store, stocked with produce from the prairie farms
or objects made at home.</p>
<p class="capbody">It was while working for Offut that Lincoln decided to improve his education.
In fair weather, when there were no customers about, Lincoln could be seen
lounging on the porch studying or talking with friends about slavery, crops,
politics, cockfighting, horse racing or just telling stories to listening loafers.</p>

<h2 id="c4">The LINCOLN COUNTRY:
<br /><span class="small">IN PICTURES
<br /><i>by Carl and Rosalie Frazier</i></span></h2>
<p>Perhaps no man in American history has
been viewed with such respect and reverence
by the American people as has Abraham
Lincoln. School children and scholars alike
have been moved by the humanity of his
deeply lined face, have marveled at his rise
from poverty to the Presidency, have sorrowed
anew at the tragedy of his death, have
read his words and been unable to erase them
from their memory. If there is one historic
person most of us would like to know, it is
Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>Here&mdash;in these pages which recreate the
world Lincoln knew as a child and a young
man&mdash;the reader can come close to Lincoln.
In these fine photographs, which carefully
depict the familiar, everyday scenes of young
Abe&rsquo;s manhood, he can see Lincoln&rsquo;s world
as Lincoln saw it. As the authors say: &ldquo;It
was from this frontier atmosphere and these
frontier people that Lincoln acquired his uncanny
understanding of how common folk
think and the wisdom that enabled him to
hold in his hands the ties that bound a people
and made a nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is this atmosphere that the authors have
captured in over 100 photographs, and it is
the rhythm of frontier life that they have
caught in the factual simplicity of the text.
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
Here is the farm in Kentucky where Lincoln
was born; here are reconstructed the smithy,
the tavern, the houses of New Salem, Illinois
where Lincoln was a clerk, where he studied
law, where he was elected to the state legislature.
Here is the Springfield that Lincoln
knew when he was first elected to Congress,
the town where his sons were born, where
in 1860 he learned that he was a candidate
for the Presidency. This is Lincoln&rsquo;s country.
As the reader follows Lincoln through the
pages of this book, he will feel suddenly
close to the man who left such an indelible
imprint on the history of this nation&mdash;and
upon its people.</p>
<p class="tb"><b>CARL and ROSALIE FRAZIER</b> live in
Chicago, Illinois where they pursue their professions
as artists and photographers. Their
knowledge of Abraham Lincoln comes from
their considerable and extensive research into
Lincoln&rsquo;s life and their many pilgrimages to
those places where he lived in Kentucky,
Indiana and Illinois.</p>
<p>The Fraziers became interested in trying to
capture through the lenses of their cameras
that certain something which attracts visitors
by the thousands to the Lincoln shrines every
year. They hope this picture book will preserve,
or at least refresh the memories of these
observant visitors, and bring to those who may
never have this opportunity a better mental
picture of this benevolent man&rsquo;s environment.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
